Large organizations have a complex internal organization structure, and therefore different data may be present in different locations, or on different operational systems, or under different schemas.
For instance, manufacturing-problem data and customer complaint data may be stored on different database systems.
Organizations often purchase data from external sources, such as mailing lists that are used for product promotions, or credit scores of customers that are provided by credit bureaus, to decide on creditworthiness of customers.
Corporate decision makers require access to information from multiple such sources. 
Setting up queries on individual sources is both cumbersome and inefficient.
Moreover, the sources of data may store only current data, whereas decision makers may need access to past data as well; for instance, information about how purchase patterns have changed in the past few years could be of great importance. 
Data warehouses provide a solution to these problems.
A data warehouse is a repository (or archive) of information gathered from multiple sources, stored under a unified schema, at a single site. Once gathered, the data are stored for a long time, permitting access to historical data. 
Thus, data warehouses provide the user a single consolidated interface to data, making decision-support queries easier to write. 
Moreover, by accessing information for decision support from a data warehouse, the decision maker ensures that online transaction-processing systems are not affected by the decision-support workload.
